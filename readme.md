## Does it Beep?

This is the Chrome and Firefox extension for [Does it Beep?](doesitbeep.com), the only product recommendation site that asks the hard-hitting question you want answered: does the damn gizmo beep or not.

Currently it, er, we'll say *parasitizes* (Best Picture Oscar Winner 2020!) certain other, better-funded product recommendation sites -- if you're looking at an item listing on a supported page, clicking the Does it Beep button in your browser toolbar will query the Does it Beep API (https://www.doesitbeep.com/api/beep.json) to match you to a Does it Beep listing for that item. If the item is not yet listed on Does it Beep, it will automatically take you to the [Github Issues page to contribute a new listing](https://github.com/axfelix/doesitbeep/issues/new/choose).

### Why did you start this project?

I started Does it Beep as a sort of fussy, ironic tribute to my dearly departed dog, who was terrified of just about anything that beeped unpredictably, and after being inspired by open source stalwart [Simon Willison](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1299028903764213760) being apparently similarly fussy.

It also sounds kind of like a discarded Bojack Horseman gag, which is just the way I intend to launch a website.

I made the site itself with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev), Netlify, and Github. I made the extension during my first week at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), because I'd never shipped a browser extension before!
